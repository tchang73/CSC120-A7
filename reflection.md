Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
    In House and Library class, I overloaded the public House() and public Library() method to have one that will only take in the name, and one that will only take in 2 parameters of name and address, sometimes you don't have all three informations available. In the Cafe class, I overloaded the restock() constructor to have another restock method that only restocks coffee ounces, because I think that that is the one that runs out the fastest, considering usually 1 coffee order takes at least 12oz.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    Finding example codes on the internet helped me get a clearer picture of how to override and overload methods. I also asked my friend for help when I got stuck, which I would advise future students to do.
